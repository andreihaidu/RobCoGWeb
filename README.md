## Games for Robot Learning

 The idea behind the project is to develop a virtual environment in which the user can interact with various assets and be able to perform real-life tasks, in order to store the information and create a semantic map for the Robot Knowledge Base. The environment represents the actual kitchen from the laboratory and the end goal is to use the game engine as a way to accumulate a large amount of trials from multiple people, in order to generate episodic memory to help the robot react when given a certain situation. The project targets more of a high-level learning, meaning that it follows the steps of the workflow as a whole rather than trajectories and control process.
